## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects: Palindrome Checker

- A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

- Note You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

- We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

- We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A33a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A33#A2".
